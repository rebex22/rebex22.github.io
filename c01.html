<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_1">1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 is one of the most widely used methods for managing projects in the world. It is a structured project management method that uses the experience gained from thousands of projects, as well as contributions from countless project sponsors, project managers, project teams, academics, trainers, and consultants.</p>
<p class="left cz">PRINCE2 je jednou z nejrozšířenějších metod pro řízení projektů na světě. Jedná se o strukturovanou metodu projektového řízení, která využívá zkušenosti získané z tisíců projektů a také příspěvky od nespočtu sponzorů projektů, projektových manažerů, projektových týmů, akademiků, školitelů a konzultantů.</p>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 has been designed to be adaptable so that it can be applied to any project, regardless of the project’s purpose, scale, type, organization, geography, or culture. This is achieved by:</p>
<p class="left cz">PRINCE2 byl navržen tak, aby byl adaptabilní, takže jej lze použít na jakýkoli projekt, bez ohledu na účel projektu, rozsah, typ, organizaci, geografickou polohu nebo kulturu. Toho je dosaženo:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  separating the management of the project from the specialist development activities, such as design or construction, allowing any specialist activities to be integrated into a controlled environment for the project <br /><i>- oddělení řízení projektu od specializovaných vývojových činností, jako je návrh nebo konstrukce, což umožňuje integraci jakýchkoli specializovaných činností do kontrolovaného prostředí projektu</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  focusing on what needs to be done to manage the project, rather than prescribing how work is done <br /><i>- zaměřit se na to, co je třeba udělat pro řízení projektu, spíše než předepisovat, jak se práce provádí</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  requiring that the method is established specifically for the needs and context of the project by the way it is applied and tailored. <br /><i>- požadavek, aby byla metoda vytvořena speciálně pro potřeby a kontext projektu způsobem, jakým je aplikována a přizpůsobena</i></p>
<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_1_1">1.1.1 Purpose of this book</h3>
<p class="left">This book is intended for anyone involved in a project that uses PRINCE2, is considering using PRINCE2, or is looking to develop their project management skills. It is designed for the following roles:</p>
<p class="left cz">Tato kniha je určena všem, kteří se podílejí na projektu, který používá PRINCE2, zvažuje použití PRINCE2 nebo chce rozvíjet své dovednosti projektového řízení. Je určen pro následující role:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  entry-level project management personnel wishing to learn about project management generally and the PRINCE2 method in particular <br /><i>- základní pracovníci projektového řízení, kteří se chtějí dozvědět o projektovém řízení obecně a konkrétně o metodě PRINCE2</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  experienced project management professionals <br /><i>- zkušení odborníci na projektové řízení</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  anyone undertaking a PRINCE2 role on a project, such as a project executive <br /><i>- kdokoli, kdo zastává roli PRINCE2 na projektu, například vedoucí projektu</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  PRINCE2 project managers who need a detailed reference source <br /><i>- Projektoví manažeři PRINCE2, kteří potřebují podrobný referenční zdroj</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  project office managers who have adopted the method for their organization or are intending to do so and require a source of information <br /><i>- vedoucí projektových kanceláří, kteří tuto metodu pro svou organizaci přijali nebo mají v úmyslu tak učinit a požadují zdroj informací</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  agile practitioners who wish to use PRINCE2 to establish appropriate project controls for their work <br /><i>- agilní odborníci, kteří chtějí používat PRINCE2 k vytvoření vhodných projektových kontrol pro svou práci</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  any personnel desiring to develop essential project management skills to improve their effectiveness. <br /><i>- jakýkoli personál, který si přeje rozvinout základní dovednosti projektového řízení ke zlepšení jejich efektivity</i></p>
<p class="left">The Official Book aims to address some questions frequently asked by those directly involved in project management or in support or other related roles. These questions include:</p>
<p class="left cz">Oficiální kniha si klade za cíl odpovědět na některé otázky, které si často kladou osoby, které se přímo podílejí na řízení projektu nebo v podpůrných či jiných souvisejících rolích. Mezi tyto otázky patří:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  what is expected of me, and what should I expect from others on the project? <br /><i>- co se ode mě očekává a co bych měl očekávat od ostatních na projektu?</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  what project decisions am I expected to make? <br /><i>- jaká projektová rozhodnutí se ode mě očekává?</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  what information do I need to supply, and what information should I receive? <br /><i>- jaké informace musím poskytnout a jaké informace bych měl obdržet?</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  what should I do if things do not go to plan? <br /><i>- co mám dělat, když věci nejdou podle plánu?</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  who should I look to for support or for direction? <br /><i>- u koho bych měl hledat podporu nebo směr?</i></p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  how can we apply and tailor the use of PRINCE2 for our project? <br /><i>- jak můžeme použít a přizpůsobit použití PRINCE2 pro náš projekt?</i></p>
<p class="left">It is not intended (or possible) for PRINCE2 to cover every aspect of project management. There are two broad topics that are deliberately considered to be outside the scope of PRINCE2: specialist aspects of project work and detailed project management techniques.</p>
<p class="left cz">Není zamýšleno (ani možné), aby PRINCE2 pokrýval všechny aspekty projektového řízení. Existují dvě široká témata, která jsou záměrně považována za mimo rozsah PRINCE2: odborné aspekty projektové práce a podrobné techniky projektového řízení.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="4" title="4" id="page-4"/>
<h4 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_1_1_1">1.1.1.1 Specialist aspects of project work</h4>
<p class="left">PRINCE2’s strength is its flexibility and the fact that it is not specific to a particular industry, type of project, commercial model, project lifecycle, delivery method, product development, or engineering practice. PRINCE2 regards these as specialist aspects of the project work and provides a means for them to be fully integrated into the management approaches to be used by the project.</p>
<p class="left cz">Síla PRINCE2 je její flexibilita a skutečnost, že není specifická pro konkrétní odvětví, typ projektu, komerční model, životní cyklus projektu, způsob dodání, vývoj produktu nebo inženýrskou praxi. PRINCE2 je považuje za specializované aspekty projektové práce a poskytuje prostředky pro jejich plnou integraci do manažerských přístupů, které má projekt používat.</p>
<h4 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_1_1_2">1.1.1.2 Detailed project management techniques</h4>
<p class="left">There are many proven project management techniques that can be used in support of the PRINCE2 method. For example, release planning, user stories, Kanban, timeboxing, retrospectives, critical path analysis, and earned value management. This book highlights various techniques that support the PRINCE2 practices, but they are not documented in detail in this book as they are already described and maintained elsewhere in various bodies of knowledge.</p>
<p class="left cz">Existuje mnoho osvědčených technik projektového řízení, které lze použít na podporu metody PRINCE2. Například plánování vydání, uživatelské příběhy, Kanban, timeboxing, retrospektivy, analýza kritických cest a správa získané hodnoty. Tato kniha zdůrazňuje různé techniky, které podporují postupy PRINCE2, ale nejsou v této knize podrobně zdokumentovány, protože jsou již popsány a udržovány jinde v různých souborech znalostí.</p>
<p class="left">Techniques are only described in detail if PRINCE2 specifically recommends that particular approach, or the approach is unique to PRINCE2, such as PRINCE2’s planning technique. Alternative (yet equivalent) techniques can be substituted, or additional techniques included if the chosen techniques are explained in the project initiation documentation.</p>
<p class="left cz">Techniky jsou podrobně popsány pouze v případě, že PRINCE2 konkrétně doporučuje tento konkrétní přístup nebo je tento přístup jedinečný pro PRINCE2, jako je například plánovací technika PRINCE2. Alternativní (ale ekvivalentní) techniky mohou být nahrazeny nebo zahrnuty další techniky, pokud jsou zvolené techniky vysvětleny v dokumentaci k zahájení projektu.</p>
<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_2">1.2 Structure of the Official Book</h2>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 is a project management method composed of five integrated elements: principles, people, practices, processes, and the project context (<a href="c01.html#fig1-1">Figure 1.1</a>).</p>
<p class="left cz">PRINCE2 je metoda projektového řízení složená z pěti integrovaných prvků: principů, lidí, postupů, procesů a kontextu projektu (<a href="c01.html#fig1-1">obrázek 1.1</a>).</p>

<p class="figcaption">Figure 1.1 The five integrated elements of PRINCE2</p>
</div>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="5" title="5" id="page-5"/>
<p class="left">The structure of this book is based on these five integrated elements:</p>
<p class="left cz">Struktura této knihy je založena na těchto pěti integrovaných prvcích:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>PRINCE2 principles:</b> the principles are the guiding obligations that determine whether the project is genuinely being managed using PRINCE2. There are seven principles, and unless all of them are applied, it is not a PRINCE2 project. The PRINCE2 principles are explained in Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>people:</b> projects need people, mainly those working on the project and those affected by the project. An understanding of the needs, capabilities, and motivations of the people involved and the relationships between them is crucial to how the project is established and managed. How people are put at the centre of the method is described in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>PRINCE2 practices:</b> the practices describe essential aspects of project management that must be applied consistently and throughout the project lifecycle. The seven practices explain the specific treatment required of that aspect of project management for the PRINCE2 processes to be effective and why they are necessary. The PRINCE2 practices are covered in <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapters 4</a> to <a href="c11.xhtml">11</a>.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>PRINCE2 processes:</b> the seven processes describe the entire project lifecycle, from activities before getting started, through the stages of project delivery, and to the final act of project closure. Each process has checklists of recommended activities and related responsibilities. The PRINCE2 processes are provided in <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapters 12</a> to <a href="c19.xhtml">19</a>.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>the project context:</b> the principles, practices, and processes are applied by the people involved to ensure that the method is fit for the project context. How PRINCE2 can be applied to common contexts is outlined in <a href="c01.xhtml#sec1_5">section 1.5</a>.</p>
<p class="left">Appendix A provides a summary of management products (such as the business case) used in the practices and processes. Appendix B provides a summary of PRINCE2 roles. The glossary summarizes the PRINCE2 defined terms that are used throughout the Official Book. Throughout this Official Book, we refer to the organization that commissions the project as the ‘business’.</p>
<div class="box def1">
<h2 class="box_title"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-1.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Key message</b></h2>
<p class="left">The five integrated elements of the PRINCE2 method are designed to work together. The practices ensure that the principles are continually applied during the processes in a way that is specific to the project context and consider the relationships and requirements of people within the project team and those outside the project team.</p>
<p class="left cz">Pět integrovaných prvků metody PRINCE2 je navrženo tak, aby spolupracovaly. Praxe zajišťuje, že zásady jsou během procesů neustále uplatňovány způsobem, který je specifický pro kontext projektu, a zohledňují vztahy a požadavky lidí v projektovém týmu i mimo projektový tým.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_3">1.3 What is a project?</h2>
<p class="left">A key challenge that organizations face is balancing two competing needs, which are:</p>
<p class="left cz">Klíčovou výzvou, které organizace čelí, je vyvážení dvou protichůdných potřeb, kterými jsou:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  maintaining current business operations, also known as business as usual (such as maintaining profitability, service quality, customer relationships, brand loyalty, productivity, and market confidence)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  improving or transforming business operations to survive and compete in the future, also known as business change (for example, anticipating and deciding how change can be introduced to the greatest effect).</p>
<p class="left">As the pace of change accelerates (whether technological, business, social, or regulatory), and the need to adapt becomes more evident, the focus of management attention is inevitably moving to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="6" title="6" id="page-6"/>achieve a balance between business as usual and business change. Projects are a means by which we introduce change, and although many of the skills required are the same, there are some crucial differences between managing business as usual and managing project work.</p>
<p class="left cz">S tím, jak se tempo změn zrychluje (ať už technologických, obchodních, sociálních nebo regulačních), a potřeba přizpůsobit se je stále evidentnější, pozornost vedení se nevyhnutelně přesouvá na <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc- pagebreak" aria-label="6" title="6" id="page-6"/>dosáhnout rovnováhy mezi běžným chodem a obchodními změnami. Projekty jsou prostředkem, kterým zavádíme změny, a přestože mnoho požadovaných dovedností je stejných, existují určité zásadní rozdíly mezi řízením běžného provozu a řízením projektové práce.</p>
<div class="box def2">
<h2 class="box_title"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-2.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Definition: project</b></h2>
<p class="left">A temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed business case.</p>
<p class="left cz">Dočasná organizace, která je vytvořena za účelem dodání jednoho nebo více obchodních produktů podle dohodnutého obchodního případu.</p>
</div>
<p class="left">There are five characteristics of a project that distinguish it from business as usual:</p>
<p class="left cz">Existuje pět charakteristik projektu, které jej odlišují od běžného provozu:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>change:</b> projects are the means by which we introduce change.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>temporary:</b> projects are temporary in nature. When the desired change has been implemented, business as usual resumes (in its new form), and the need for the project is removed. As projects are temporary, they should therefore have a defined start and a defined end.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>cross-functional:</b> a project involves a team of people with different skills working together on a temporary basis to introduce a change that will impact others outside the team. Projects often work across the usual functional divisions within an organization and sometimes span different organizations. This frequently causes stresses and strains both within and between organizations (for example, between customers and suppliers). Each has a different perspective and motivation for getting involved in the project.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>unique:</b> every project is unique. An organization may undertake many similar projects and establish a familiar, proven pattern of project activity, but each one will differ in a certain way. This can mean a different team, customer, supplier, product, location, or timeframe. All these factors combine to make every project unique.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>uncertainty:</b> the characteristics already listed will introduce threats and opportunities over and above those typically encountered within business as usual. Projects are riskier than any operational aspects of an organization.</p>
<p class="left">Projects vary greatly. For example, an organization might undertake an IT project to improve the systems required to manage its business. Another organization might undertake a clinical research project to bring a new drug to market, and another organization might be building a new facility. Furthermore, the environment within which the project is being managed may influence how it is started, delivered, assured, and closed. There may be factors external to the project itself, such as organizational standards, the maturity of the organization, and regulatory frameworks and factors specific to the individual project, such as the industry sector and the geographical locations. PRINCE2 is designed to work for all types of projects in any project environment.</p>
<p class="left cz">Projekty se velmi liší. Organizace může například provést projekt IT s cílem zlepšit systémy potřebné pro řízení jejího podnikání. Jiná organizace může provést klinický výzkumný projekt s cílem uvést na trh nový lék a jiná organizace může budovat nové zařízení. Kromě toho prostředí, ve kterém je projekt řízen, může ovlivnit, jak je zahájen, dodáván, zajištěn a uzavřen. Mohou existovat faktory mimo projekt samotný, jako jsou organizační standardy, vyspělost organizace a regulační rámce a faktory specifické pro jednotlivý projekt, jako je průmyslový sektor a geografické lokality. PRINCE2 je navržen tak, aby fungoval pro všechny typy projektů v jakémkoli projektovém prostředí.</p>
<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_4">1.4 What is project management?</h2>
<div class="box def2">
<h2 class="box_title"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-2.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Definition: project management</b></h2>
<p class="left">Project management is the application of methods, tools, techniques, and competencies to enable the project to meet its objectives.</p>
</div>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="7" title="7" id="page-7"/>
<p class="left">The five characteristics of a project (1.3) can result in some typical challenges such as:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  ambiguity regarding who is responsible for what aspects of the project, leading to confusion and a lack of accountability</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  ambiguity or conflict regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  unrealistic expectations regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  unavailability of resources or reassigning resources to business as usual activities over project work</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  difficulty in estimating effort, durations, and costs for project work</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  difficulty keeping the project management team and stakeholders informed, engaged, and motivated during the project lifecycle.</p>
<p class="left">The purpose of project management is to address these challenges by reducing and managing ambiguity. This is achieved by uniting the involved parties to clarify objectives and working practices. The aim is to control the specialist work needed to create the products required of the project. Project management involves the planning, delegating, monitoring, and control of all aspects of the project and the motivation of those involved to achieve the project objectives within expected performance targets.</p>
<div class="box def2">
<h2 class="box_title"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-2.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Definition: performance target</b></h2>
<p class="left">The project’s performance target sets the expected success level against which the management of the project will be judged. PRINCE2 includes performance targets for benefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk.</p>
</div>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 includes seven aspects of project performance to be managed. These are:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>benefits:</b> those involved in the project need to be able to answer the question: why are we doing this, and who are we doing it for? The project management team must have a clear understanding of the purpose of the project and what needs to be achieved to justify its investment.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>costs:</b> as the project develops, there will be many factors that can affect the cost budget available or that may lead to (potential) underspend or overspend against the cost budget. The project has to be affordable.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>time:</b> when will the project start, when will the key products be delivered, and when will the project finish?</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>quality:</b> finishing on time and within budget is not much consolation if the result of the project is not as specified or does not work. What is delivered by the project must be fit for purpose.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>scope:</b> what will the project deliver? There must be agreement on the project’s scope, otherwise the various parties involved may make different assumptions about what is included or excluded. The project management team should not deliver beyond the scope, as this is a common source of delays, overspend, and uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep).</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>sustainability:</b> all projects have an impact on their environment, and project management teams need to know the sustainability performance targets for the project work and for the products required of the project.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>risk:</b> all projects involve risk. But exactly how much risk is the business prepared to take? Without a shared understanding of the business’ risk appetite, the project management team may be too risk-averse or take more risks than the business is prepared to accept.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="8" title="8" id="page-8"/>
<p class="left">Priorities can be established by agreeing on the project’s performance targets. For example, an urgent project may place more importance on time than on other performance targets, such as costs. PRINCE2 helps with setting such priorities by allowing a range to be specified for each performance target in the form of tolerances (see <a href="c02.xhtml#sec2_4">section 2.4</a>). Some performance targets may have a narrow tolerance, yet others may have a broader tolerance. The agreement of performance targets and their tolerances is a prerequisite for exploring options and determining the project approach.</p>
<p class="left">All seven project performance targets and their tolerances are used throughout the PRINCE2 method as the basis for control.</p>
<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5">1.5 The project context</h2>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 has been designed so it can work within any context including organizational and commercial context, delivery method, sustainability requirements, and project scale. These common contexts are described throughout this book to illustrate how PRINCE2 can be applied or tailored.</p>
<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5_1">1.5.1 Organizational context</h3>
<p class="left">The PRINCE2 method does not assume any specific organizational context. There may be users who specify the desired outputs (referred to as products in PRINCE2), suppliers who will provide the resources and expertise to deliver the products, and business decision-makers who will ensure that the project investment can be justified and remains justified through the project lifecycle. The PRINCE2 method does not require any specific organizational relationships between the users, suppliers, and business decision-makers for the project. The users, suppliers, and business decision-makers may all come from the same organization, or they may be in separate organizations with commercial agreements between them.</p>
<p class="left">Within the PRINCE2 method, the business decision-makers come from the organization that commissions the project. The decision-making will be made within the context of the business strategy, objectives, and policies of the organization.</p>
<div class="box def2">
<h2 class="box_title"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-2.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Definitions</b></h2>
<p class="left"><b>Business:</b> the organization that provides the project mandate and the structure within which the project is governed.</p>
<p class="left"><b>User:</b> the organization that will use the project products to enable it to gain the expected benefits. They may be internal or external to the business organization.</p>
<p class="left"><b>Supplier:</b> the organization that provides the expertise, people, and resources required to deliver the products required by the project. They may be internal or external to the business organization. </p>
<p class="left"><b>Customer:</b> where there is a commercial relationship between the business and the supplier, the business is regarded as the customer. </p>
</div>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="9" title="9" id="page-9"/>
<p class="left">The project may be part of a programme or portfolio structure, or it may be a standalone project reporting to the business unit’s management structure, as illustrated in <a href="c01.xhtml#fig1-2">Figure 1.2</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig1-2">
<img src="images/1-2.jpg" alt=""/>
<p class="figcaption">Figure 1.2 Various project contexts</p>
</div>
<p class="left">Further guidance on programme management and portfolio management can be found in the companion guides Managing Successful Programmes and Management of Portfolios.</p>
<p class="left">The business is also responsible for realizing any benefits after the completion of the project (see <a href="c05.xhtml#sec5_3_1_4">section 5.3.1.4</a>).</p>
<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5_2">1.5.2 Commercial context</h3>
<p class="left">The business may have entered into a commercial relationship with a supplier to deliver products that fulfil the needs of the users as defined in the project’s business case. The organization delivering the project (the supplier) will do so to satisfy a particular need identified by the business (the customer).</p>
<p class="left">The business may divide the work into one or more elements, some of which may require suppliers to deliver. Other elements may be delivered by the business itself, for example, an internal department such as IT or facilities. For a supplier, the work to be delivered could be the subject of a legally binding contract, resulting from the procurement process. To deliver this work, the supplier might procure subcontractors itself, further dividing its work into additional elements.</p>
<p class="left">In a commercial environment, there may be hierarchies of commercial relationships between suppliers. Rather than a simple customer-supplier relationship involving two organizations, projects might involve multiple organizations covered by multiple contracts. There may be a single customer with a prime contractor, or there may be several customers and several supplier organizations, each of which may have its own business reasons for undertaking the project.</p>
<p class="left">The contract between the parties describes how the customer(s) and supplier(s) will collaborate to deliver the project. The rights and duties covered by the agreement will need to be reflected in how the project is managed.</p>
<p class="left">In this book, the term ‘customer’ is only used where there is a commercial relationship between the business and the supplier.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="10" title="10" id="page-10"/>
<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5_3">1.5.3 Delivery method</h3>
<p class="left">The delivery method is the way in which the work of the project is to be delivered. The project may rely on one or more delivery methods to create the required products. Typical delivery methods include:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>linear-sequential approach:</b> each of the delivery steps to create the products occurs in sequence, and the product is made available during or at the end of the project (for example, in a construction project where requirements gathering and design occur before construction starts).</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>iterative-incremental approach:</b> this approach is often, but not exclusively, used for product development, where requirements gathering, design, development and/or coding, and testing occur iteratively throughout the lifecycle of the project. This approach is often referred to as an agile approach.</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>hybrid approach:</b> some elements of the project use a linear-sequential approach, and other elements use an iterative-incremental approach. For example, a linear-sequential approach can be used for the development of the infrastructure for a service. Then, an iterative-incremental approach can be used for the development of the customer service portal for users to access the service.</p>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 provides the controlled environment for specialist delivery methods. It does not assume or require any specific delivery method. Any approach can be used through the separation of the management of the project and specialist work to produce the project products. Detailed and complementary guidance on working on iterative-incremental projects using PRINCE2 can be found in the PRINCE2 Agile Official Book.</p>
<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5_4">1.5.4 Sustainability context</h3>
<p class="left">The business is likely to have sustainability objectives and commitments that the project needs to adhere or contribute to, which will inform the project’s objectives and how it is established and managed. PRINCE2, addresses sustainability requirements by including sustainability as one of the seven performance targets used to manage the project. Sustainability is also included in the method through the roles (sustainability responsibilities), documentation (such as plans and reports), practices (such as business case), and processes (such as activities to confirm sustainability requirements).</p>
<p class="left">In everyday usage of the term, sustainability is often synonymous with the environment, but sustainability can mean different things to different organizations. For some, it may relate to the environmental impact of the project work, while for others it may relate to the whole life cost of the products delivered by the project and their resilience in operations. Some projects may have sustainability as their very purpose, such as the installation of solar panels.</p>
<p class="left">Unless otherwise specified, this book uses sustainability to mean one, some, or all of the 17 sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations.</p>

<h3 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_5_5">1.5.5 Scale</h3>
<p class="left">The PRINCE2 method is flexible, so it can be simplified for small or simple projects or expanded for large or complex projects to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p class="left">The perceived scale of a project is relative to the organization. What is considered a small project in a large multinational enterprise could be bigger than what is considered a large project in a small organization. It is usually more helpful to think of projects in terms of simple rather than small and complex rather than large. Generally, it is a case of how the business perceives the risk and the importance of the project, relative to its business as usual operations.</p>
<p class="left">PRINCE2 can be tailored to the scale of the project via the:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  governance arrangements between the business layer, the project board, the project manager, and the teams</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  choice of which project roles are appointed to individuals from the user, business, and supplier organizations (for example, combining roles in simple projects and dividing roles in complex projects)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  formality and level of detail of project documentation (in PRINCE2 these are referred to as management products)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  formality of the project controls (for example, frequency of reporting and reviewing)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  selection and integration of the management approaches, such as a commercial management or change management approach</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  number of stages and work packages the project is divided into</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  setting of the project performance targets and their tolerances.</p>

<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_6">1.6 Features and benefits of PRINCE2</h2>
<p class="left">As PRINCE2 is flexible and based on proven principles, organizations adopting the method as a standard can substantially improve their organizational capability and maturity across multiple areas of business activity, such as business change, construction, IT, mergers and acquisitions, research, and product development.</p>
<p class="left">In addition to being an established method and qualification used worldwide, PRINCE2 has the following benefits:</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>proven:</b> based on established and proven practice and governance for project management</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>universal:</b> can be applied to any project, of any scale, and easily implemented alongside specialist, industry-specific models (such as engineering models or development lifecycles)</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>flexible:</b> can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the organizations involved</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>common language and concepts:</b> widely recognized and provides a common vocabulary for all participants, which encourages consistency and the ability to reuse project assets, facilitate staff mobility, and reduce the impact of personnel changes or handovers</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>outcome-focused:</b> ensures that project participants focus on the viability of the project in relation to its business case objectives, rather than simply seeing the completion of the project as an end in itself, which ensures that stakeholders (including sponsors and resource providers) are properly represented in planning and decision-making</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>increased organizational maturity:</b> promotes learning from project experience and continual improvement in organizations</p>
<p class="bullet_1">●  <b>part of an integrated suite of methods:</b> designed to work with other PeopleCert guides on programme management, portfolio management and risk management.</p>
<h2 class="sect capt01" id="sec1_7">1.7 Example scenarios</h2>
<p class="left">There are four example scenarios used throughout this guide, which demonstrate how the PRINCE2 method can be applied to a wide range of projects. A short summary of each scenario is provided below. Some of the scenarios feature projects at an early stage in their development, whereas others are partway through the project lifecycle. The following icons represent each of the scenarios that appear throughout the guide.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="13" title="13" id="page-13"/>
<div class="boxn">
<h2 class="box_title capt01"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-3.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Scenario 1: Data Knowledge</b></h2>
<p class="left">Data Knowledge is a company with the mission of leveraging the power of big data through advanced data analytics solutions. By analysing the wants, needs, desires, and frustrations of social media users, Data Knowledge can transform raw and unstructured data into reliable predictions that enable organizations to utilize consumer behaviours and insights.</p>
<p class="left">However, they have not been as effective in using data to their own advantage, now that the company has over 300 staff. In fact, the head of the data science division raised concerns in the last senior leadership team meeting. The concerns were regarding the lack of visibility of who is working on what projects, poor capacity planning, and claims of an overworked team with low morale due to the constant juggling of commitments and firefighting issues.</p>
<p class="left">As a way of addressing this, the data science division has been authorized to start a project to develop a time-recording solution and a set of reports on project and task assignments along with resource utilization and capacity planning. The reports are expected to offer interactive and real-time insights that can enable data-driven decisions around the utilization and planning of resources.</p>
<p class="left">Data Knowledge has a defined framework for the management of projects. This is expected to be a simple business change project, taking no more than three months in the current financial year to complete.</p>
<p class="left">Since Data Knowledge has in-house data analysis and app development capabilities as well as clear requirements for this project, the project will be led by the head of data science. They will work with the development division in an iterative and incremental approach. This is to ensure that the solution can be deployed quickly to several new projects and enhanced during its roll-out to the rest of the business.</p>
<p class="left">The high-level project plan is as follows:</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 1 (initiation)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  product backlog</p>
<p class="bullet">●  minimum viable product definition</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 2</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  timebox 1</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  prototype of time-recording application</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  mock-up of resource management reports</p>
<p class="bullet">●  timebox 2</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  first release of time-recording application and reports (must-have features)</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  pilot</p>
<p class="bullet">●  timebox 3</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  enhancements following pilot</p>
<p class="bullet">●  timebox 4</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  demonstration</p>
<p class="bullet1">●  roll-out</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 3</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  product backlog (following roll-out)</p>
<p class="bullet">●  closure.</p>
<p class="left">The main output from the project is to be a time-recording application and set of resource management reports available to all business units.</p>

<h2 class="box_title capt01"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-4.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Scenario 2: Louistown City Council</b></h2>
<p class="left">Louistown is a historical town which is home to over 40,000 residents and attracts over 20,000 visitors per year. The city council has been criticized for the lack of investment and modernization of the town centre.</p>
<p class="left">They have recently decided to improve the vibrancy of the area and offer increased opportunities for business by approving the funds for the ‘Louistown is Open for Business’ (LOB) portfolio. This is an ambitious portfolio of projects covering the next five-year plan cycle.</p>
<p class="left">A new shopping centre, provisionally named ‘LouisShopping’, is seen as a key project within this portfolio. This is a complex infrastructure project due to the:</p>
<p class="bullet">●  location of the building and historical nature of the surrounding buildings</p>
<p class="bullet">●  requirement for the design to be consistent with the environment while offering modern facilities supported by the latest technology</p>
<p class="bullet">●  need to include underground parking space</p>
<p class="bullet">●  importance of minimizing disruption to residents and businesses during the construction works</p>
<p class="bullet">●  recent award of ‘green town’ status to Louistown, and the sustainability requirements this will impose on the development.</p>
<p class="left">Due to the nature of the work, in which just the construction element is likely to span over two financial years, the council has approved the strategic business case, the initial high-level project plan and has appointed BuildyBrick as the main contractor. They have established a requirement for a traditional delivery method in line with their standard approach to projects. The general view is that this project is long overdue, and the council would like ‘LouisShopping’ to be open to the public by the end of financial year three.</p>
<p class="left">The project has just completed the initiation stage and commenced the first delivery stage (stage 2). The high-level project plan is as follows:</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 1 (initiation)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  strategic business case and high-level project plan approval</p>
<p class="bullet">●  appoint contractor</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 2</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  design</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 3</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  site preparation</p>
<p class="bullet">●  utilities and systems</p>
<p class="bullet">●  construction</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 4</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  testing</p>
<p class="bullet">●  inspections</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 5</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  demobilization.</p>
<p class="left">The main output from the project is a shopping centre constructed and ready to open to the public.</p>

<h2 class="box_title capt01"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-5.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Scenario 3: Findef</b></h2>
<p class="left">Findef was formed eight years ago with the promise to revolutionize how businesses identify fraudsters, to protect the reputation of businesses, and to minimize financial risks. The company experienced substantial growth in the first few years, transforming from a niche small-medium-enterprise (SME) to one of the leading fintech firms in the field of financial fraud, working with the world’s largest banks and merchants. In the last 18 months, Findef’s growth has stagnated. This factor, coupled with the arrival of new competitors, is creating discomfort among some investors.</p>
<p class="left">In response, the leadership board recently approved the development of a suite of three innovative cybersecurity products that will transform the market in financial risk management. Additionally, the leadership board agreed that Findef will change its commercial and operating models to exploit the new products to their full potential. The company will now deal directly with the end user rather than through banks and merchants.</p>
<p class="left">The FindefTwo programme has been established to oversee both the business transformation and the development of the new products. As the programme requires fresh investment, the board has established an investment committee that funds and oversees the programme.</p>
<p class="left">The project for the product development will use a hybrid approach of linear-sequential for the overarching design and deployment of the product set and iterative-incremental for the development of each product. The project also includes upskilling Findef’s DevOps team in a new development platform. To mitigate some risks, the project includes procuring advisors and a marketing agency that could validate assumptions and share their product experience with the company.</p>
<p class="left">The project is at the beginning of stage 3. The high-level project plan for the product development project is as follows:</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 1 (initiation)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  business case, project initiation documentation</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 2 (high-level design)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  request for proposals (advisor, marketing agency, training), contract awards</p>
<p class="bullet">●  product design (product family architecture)</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 3 (detailed design)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  product design: product 1</p>
<p class="bullet">●  early market testing</p>
<p class="bullet">●  DevOps upskilling</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 4 (MVP product 1)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  iterative-incremental development and soft launch of product 1 to minimum viable product (MVP)</p>
<p class="bullet">●  product design: product 2, product design: product 3</p>
<p class="left"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="16" title="16" id="page-16"/><b>Stage 5 (MVP products 2 and 3)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  product 1 ready for full launch</p>
<p class="bullet">●  iterative-incremental development and soft launch of products 2 and 3 to minimum viable products (MVP)</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 6 (first launch)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  transfer product 1 to BAU support</p>
<p class="bullet">●  product 2 ready for full launch, product 3 ready for full launch</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 7 (second launch)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  transfer product 2 to BAU support, transfer product 3 to BAU support</p>
<p class="bullet">●  closure.</p>
<p class="left">The main output from the project will be three products ready for full launch and transferred to BAU for operations and maintenance.</p>

<h2 class="box_title capt01"><img class="inline_logo" src="images/cm-6.jpg" alt=""/> <b>Scenario 4: NowByou</b></h2>
<p class="left">NowByou is a not-for-profit organization that works with local communities to eliminate discrimination of any kind and help advance the international human rights system through local and targeted interventions.</p>
<p class="left">NowByou forms, chairs, and equips networking and support groups, where anyone who has experienced discrimination can share their experiences and thoughts in a safe and empowering space. Additionally, NowByou is one of the few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country that works directly with police forces to co-develop campaigns that encourage the reporting of discriminatory incidents to authorities.</p>
<p class="left">Recent research has shown that discrimination against marginalized groups, particularly the homeless and refugees, is growing at a concerning rate. The increase in discrimination has led NowByou to believe that a new six-month campaign is required to address this issue.</p>
<p class="left">They have decided to run the campaign as a project, aiming to both raise awareness of this type of discrimination and reinforce their own brand recognition (as NowByou is highly dependent on the goodwill of donors and financial aid from partners).</p>
<p class="left">The project management maturity of the organization is very low, with no standardized processes or templates in place. For that reason, NowByou has contacted a professional project manager with a track record of successful delivery in the not-for-profit sector who will be responsible for:</p>
<p class="bullet">●  developing the initial project management documentation</p>
<p class="bullet">●  advising and coaching the NowByou director of campaigns, who is sponsoring the project</p>
<p class="bullet">●  mentoring the staff member who will be appointed as project manager</p>
<p class="bullet">●  advise the project team how to use a variety of media (tv, press, and social networks) for this, and other future projects.</p>
<p class="left">There is a high-level view of the project, but this is to be confirmed, as pre-project discussions are still occurring:</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 1 (initiation)</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  business case</p>
<p class="bullet">●  project initiation documentation</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 2</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  campaign high-level requirements gathering</p>
<p class="bullet">●  options analysis</p>
<p class="left"><b>Stage 3</b></p>
<p class="bullet">●  implementation of chosen option(s)</p>
<p class="bullet">●  closure.</p>
<p class="left">The main output from the project will be a delivered multi-channel campaign.</p>
